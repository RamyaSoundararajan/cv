      <h2>Mini Project</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Topic:Laboratory Power Saving and Automation</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>In our laboratory many electronic and electrical devices like PC, motors, CROâ€™s, fan, and light are connected. 
            Sometimes we may forget to off the equipments while we are coming out of the laboratory. So to overcome this 
            problem we use our idea.Automatic lab power control".</li>
        <br>
        <li>We connected counter at way in and out of the laboratory. The counter increases and decreases at the time of each person entering and leaving in the laboratory. And another application of our project is Fan and Light ON and OFF automatically to saving wastage of power.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Main Project</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Topic:HRM RE-HEATING FURANCE TEMPERATURE                                                                    
        CONTROLLER USING MICROCONTROLLER</h3>
    <br>
      <ul>
        <li>In our project the microcontroller is used for the measurement of the product which involves the measure of weight, length and width. If the fault measure is identified, the alarm is used for the initialization of product rejection. The fault in the size of any product can be detected and appropriate action can be carried out using this project.  </li>
        <br>
        <li>When the product is heated up to certain amount as fixed earlier, the sensor is used to sense the heat variation and the motors of the conveyer are operated automatically for the extraction of the product for the further process of reducing the width and increasing the length of the product.</li>
